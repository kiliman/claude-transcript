> I've got the code for converting claude code .jsonl files into markdown transcripts and it works pretty well. I would like to clean up the code by refactoring, removing duplicates, consistency in naming, etc. I prefer code to be written top-down, where main is at the top, followed by more specific functions. I think it's easier to read and understand this flow. Think hard and come up with a plan to simplify and improve this code.

I'll help you refactor the code for converting Claude Code .jsonl files into markdown transcripts. Let me first examine the codebase to understand the current structure and then create a plan for improvement.
