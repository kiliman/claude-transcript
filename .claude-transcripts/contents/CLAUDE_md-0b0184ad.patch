+## Version Bumping
+When asked to "bump version" or "bump the version":
+1. Analyze changes since last version to determine appropriate semver bump:
+   - **Patch (x.x.1)**: Bug fixes, internal refactoring, documentation updates
+   - **Minor (x.1.0)**: New features that are backwards compatible, new options
+   - **Major (1.0.0)**: Breaking changes to the API
+2. Update package.json with the new version number
+3. Update CHANGELOG.md with a new entry listing all changes, grouped by type:
+   - Use conventional commit emojis (‚ú® features, üêõ fixes, ‚ôªÔ∏è refactoring, üìù docs, etc.)
+   - Include explanation of why that version bump was chosen
+4. Commit both files with a release commit message
