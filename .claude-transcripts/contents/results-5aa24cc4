I'll analyze this codebase to create a CLAUDE.md file that will help future Claude instances work productively with this repository.

ðŸ“‹ **Task: Analyze codebase structure**

Please analyze the codebase structure and identify key files:
1. Look for package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, or similar files to understand the project type
2. Check for README.md to understand the project purpose
3. Look for any existing CLAUDE.md file
