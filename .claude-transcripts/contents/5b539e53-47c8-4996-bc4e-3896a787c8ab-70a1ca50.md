    37→For each `metric`, we're going to execute the shell command at the requested frequency (a numeric value with a time unit of: s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hour)
    38→
    39→The command will output to stdout one or more lines
    40→```
    41→name: value [unit]
    42→```
    43→<example>
    44→duration: 123 ms
    45→status: 200
    46→</example>
    47→
    48→Each time a command is executed, we're going to store the following data in a sqlite database
    49→```
    50→timestamp (unix time), key, name, value, unit
    51→```
    52→<example>
    53→1753219424, bde, duration, 123, ms
    54→1753219424, bde, status, 200
    55→</example>
    56→
    57→We also want to create a table that keeps a rolling summary of each metric
    58→
    59→We'll rollup the values in the following increments, starting with the first increment greater than our frequency.
    60→
    61→5 minutes (5m)
    62→30 minutes (30m)
    63→1 hour (1h)
    64→12 hours (12h)
    65→1 day (1d)
    66→1 month (1mo)
    67→1 year (1y)
    68→
    69→For each group, we'll keep a maximum on the latest 120 entries.
    70→
    71→We'll capture the following data
    72→```
    73→increment, timestamp, key, name, unit, min, max, average
    74→```
    75→- increment is the interval key in parentheses.
    76→- timestamp is the unix time rounded to nearest increment
    77→    - 5m 00:00, 00:05, 00:10, etc.
    78→    - 30m 00:00, 00:30, 01:00, etc.
    79→    - 1h 00:00, 01:00, 02:00, etc.
    80→    - 1d 2025-07-21T00:00, 2025-07-22T00:00, etc.
    81→    - 1m 2025-07-01T00:00, 2025-08-01T00:00, etc.
    82→    - 1y 2025-01-01T00:00, 2026-01-01T00:00, etc.
    83→- key, name, unit from metric
    84→- min*
    85→- max*
