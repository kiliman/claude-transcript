Description

 Disallow TypeScript enum.

 TypeScript enums are not a type-level extension to JavaScript like type annotations or definitions.
 Users may wish to disable non-type-level extensions to use bundlers or compilers that only strip types.

 Const enums are not covered by this rule since `noConstEnum` already handles them.
 Enums within the ambient context, including declaration files, are ignores as well.
