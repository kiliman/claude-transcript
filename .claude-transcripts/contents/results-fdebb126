Description

 Disallow TypeScript `const enum`

 Const enums are enums that should be inlined at use sites.
 Const enums are not supported by bundlers and are incompatible with the `isolatedModules` mode.
 Their use can lead to import nonexistent values (because const enums are erased).

 Thus, library authors and bundler users should not use const enums.
